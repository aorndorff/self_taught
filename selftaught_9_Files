# Writing to files 
# 1. Open a file.  Use "Open" function w/ 2 parameters
#       1a. string representing the path to the file to open 
#       1b. string representing the mode to open the file in

# The "Path" function takes each folder and builds a file path for you

import os
print (os.path.join("Users", "bob", "st.txt"))

# Mode you pass to the "open" function determines what actions you will be able to perform on the file you open
    # 'r' - opens file for read only
    # 'w' - opens a file for writing only
        # If file does not exist, it creates it.
    # 'w+' - opens a file for reading and writing
# 'Open' function returns an object called a FILE OBJECT
    # you can use it to read and/or write to your file.
